Use the following order of creating a cover letter for the given job description:

1. Break barriers of communication by creating hope in a professional manner that the problem can be solved quickly
2. Create a hook, so the client wants to read the proposal given they have many proposals  to go through
3. Show authority that Iam the right person to solve this problem

5. Hammer the above message home 

Here is a copy of my resume:

{resume}

Below are some examples of how it should sound like:

{examples}
To achieve the required task, I'd need:
1. Access to your SQL server or a developer version (essentially a copy which I can create too)
2. Access to the CMS server that you are using
3. Some ideas about how you would like to interact with the price configurator. I can create designs for these based on it if you don't already have them

Based on the CMS service you are using I will connect it with the SQL server using an existing plugin or develop one depending on the need and then try to find the easiest way to display that information on the website. Unless changes are required to the SQL script, I will try to avoid it to keep the project short and simple.
